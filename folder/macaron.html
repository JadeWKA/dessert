    <p id="process">

        1. Macaron Shells:<br> <br>
        Place your egg whites in a bowl <br> 
        Sieve the Icing sugar and whisk together 
        in a separate bowl. Then whiz dry the ingredients
        in a food processor. This is to ensure
        that you have smooth shells and no bumpy ones. Hence, 
        the more you do it, the better the result.
        <br><br>
        In your bowl of egg whites, use a wisk and set your machine on high. 
        Once it gets frothy, you add the sugar little by little. This will take
        some time so do not rush this process or else your meringue will break 
        and it could lead to hollow shells or break the shells. 
        <br><br>
        Once that is ready, you add 1/3 of your ddry ingredients (almond flour and
        icing sugar) into the meringue. And then FOLD it (also known as macronage). 
        Add another 1/3 and repeat this process until you have no more dry ingredients
        left to fold. Then you just PRESS your meringue, to get rid of air bubbles. 
        To know when it is ready, you can form an 8 with your spatula. DO NOT 
        OVER MIX THIS. If you do, you will see that it is too runny.  
        <br><br>
        Now it is time for piping. Be sure when you pipe, you pipe on top. 
        Do no tilt your hand and pipe sideways. Your macaron shells will not 
        grow nicely. You can pipe this with parchment or silicon mats. When your 
        aiming for a specific size, be sure to pipe a few cm less. This is because
        on the next step, you will take the whole tray and tap it down and they will
        increase its size. At the same time, it removes the air bubbles that still 
        remain in the macarons. you don't want to tap it too much. If there are still
        some bumpy spots on your shells, you can use a skewer or a pin. Let it rest.
        Depending on your environment, you might have to wait 30 min - 1hr for this 
        to be ready to bake in the oven. To know when they're ready, you will notice
        that your shells have become less shiny and they're dry to the touch. So be 
        sure to gently touch it and see if they are ready to go.
        <br><br>
        Place your tray into the center rack of your oven at 300 degrees fahrenheit 
        for 14 min. Be sure at 7 min, to flip them over so that the other half also 
        gets baked well. It really depends on your oven, so if you see that they 
        still haven't risen up, leave it for a few more minutes. Once they are 
        ready, take them out and let it cool. If you immediately take it out, your 
        bottom of the shell will stick to the parchment paper and ruin it. 
        <br><br> 
        American Buttercream:
        Soft butter meaning that you leave your butter out and it's soft
        to the touch. Wisk the butter into your machine for 5 min. Pour half of the 
        icing sugar into the bowl and whisk it on the low or else the powdered sugar 
        will blow all over the place. So start slowly and then increase the speed for
        3 min. Then add the rest of the powdered sugar with vanilla extract and milk.
        Wisk it for 2 min until it is nice and fluffy. At this point you can add Food
        coloring and flavor and it is ready to be piped for your macarons. Done!
